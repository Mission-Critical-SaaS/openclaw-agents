## Tool Access Matrix

| Tool | Scout | Trak | Kit |
|------|-------|------|-----|
| **Jira** (MCP) | ✅ Full — ticket lookup, creation, search | ✅ Full (primary) — sprint tracking, issue management | ⚠️ Limited — issue lookup only |
| **Zendesk** (MCP) | ✅ Full — ticket search, create, update, comments | ❌ Not configured | ❌ Not configured |
| **Notion** (MCP) | ❌ Not configured | ❌ Not configured | ❌ Not configured |
| **GitHub** (gh CLI) | ⚠️ Limited — issue search only | ✅ Full — PRs, issues, repos | ✅ Full (primary) — PRs, CI, code review |

**Note**: Notion is available as an MCP server but not yet assigned to any agent's identity. All three agents CAN access it if their IDENTITY.md is updated.

---

## How Tool Access Works

Tool access is controlled at TWO levels:

### 1. MCP Server Level
All MCP servers (Jira, Zendesk, Notion) are available to all agents via the shared MCP server configuration. The inner entrypoint (`docker/entrypoint.sh`) generates this config at `/root/.mcporter/mcporter.json` on each container start.

### 2. Agent Identity Level
Each agent's `IDENTITY.md` file defines which tools the agent should USE. The gateway doesn't restrict tool access — agents self-select based on their identity instructions. An agent without Zendesk in its IDENTITY.md can technically access Zendesk tools but won't know to do so.

### Making Tool Access Changes

Tool access changes require:
- Editing the agent's IDENTITY.md file (on the host at `/opt/openclaw/agents/<name>/workspace/IDENTITY.md`)
- Restarting the container so the agent picks up the new identity

## Testing Each Agent

### Quick Smoke Test (DM each agent)
```
Scout: "Search Zendesk for open tickets"
Trak: "Show me the top 5 open bugs in the LMNTL project"
Kit: "Check the CI status for the latest PR on lmntl repo"
```

### Integration Verification
```bash
# On EC2, verify MCP server health
docker exec openclaw-agents bash -c '
    while IFS= read -r -d "" line; do export "$line"; done < /proc/1/environ
    openclaw status
'
# Expected: 3 servers, all healthy

# Verify each agent's identity is loaded
for agent in scout trak kit; do
  docker exec openclaw-agents head -3 /root/.openclaw/agents/$agent/workspace/IDENTITY.md
done
```

## Quick Reference: Agent Identities

Each agent loads its capabilities from:
- **Scout**: `/root/.openclaw/agents/scout/workspace/IDENTITY.md`
- **Trak**: `/root/.openclaw/agents/trak/workspace/IDENTITY.md`
- **Kit**: `/root/.openclaw/agents/kit/workspace/IDENTITY.md`

The IDENTITY.md file contains:
- Tool availability declarations
- Personality and communication style
- Context about the agent's role and responsibilities
- Specific Jira projects or GitHub orgs the agent focuses on
